## Overview of the statistical analysis
> The purpose of this analysis is to identify the peak hours of use of a bikesharing service (CitiBike) during the month of August in 2019 in New York City. The goal is to show a potential service for other cities to use. 

## Results
>The amount of customers and subscribers that used the service during August shows that the service is widely used by many people regularly. The number of subscribers means many people are repeatedly using the service during ht e month.

>Riders with unkown genders are not likely to be subsribers to the service. There are more subscribers than one time use customers.

## Summary
> My final thoughts are that men use the service more than other genders and the majority of use for the service happens to be people commute to and from work each weekday and less so on weekends. Some future visulizations that could be done is checking to see if there is a prefered start and end location or which bikes in particular get uses the most.
